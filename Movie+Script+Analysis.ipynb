Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle... BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. He starts reloading as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife. Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make it in time... the warrior leaps toward him... ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall... flies back to the ground, very dead.

Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara. The water deepens, and they start swimming toward the flatboat. ARROWS HISS into the water all around them. Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol...

The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat. Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's head. The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck.\",\n",
